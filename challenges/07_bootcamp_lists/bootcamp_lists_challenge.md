## Challenge

In this challenge, we're giving you a script called `box_office_challenge.py` that you'll be working on to manage the list of the Top 100 Highest Grossing Movies at the Box Office from 1999. This year included classics like The Matrix, Fight Club, Sixth Sense and many others.

To get started, make a folder inside your `jtc_class_code/challenges` called `07_bootcamp_lists`, and put `box_office_challenge.py` in there. You can use `ls` inside the folder to make sure the `box_office_challenge.py` script is really in there!

### When you're done, "Push" to Github

As the final part of your workflow for this challenge, stage your files (`git add .`), commit (_don't forget a commit message_), and push the `box_office_challenge.py` script you worked on to your `jtc_class_code` github repository.

- Remember to check your Github repo online at the end to make sure this worked
