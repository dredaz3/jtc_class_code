In your jtc_class_code git repository, in the challenges folder, first make a folder called `03_primitive_data_types_part_1`. Inside this folder, you can make a script called `temperature.py` and run it using `python temperature.py` to verify you get the expected output. 

### The formula for converting between fahrenheit and celsius is to first subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9. Can you do the following in python?

1. Convert a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    * Save this to a variable called `celsius_100`, and use `print()` to print out the value
    * Is the resulting temperature you get an integer or float? How do you know?
2. Convert a temperature of 0 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    * Save this to a variable called `celsius_0`, and use `print()` to print out the value
3. Convert a temperature of 34.2 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    * Do this one all in one print statement **without** saving any variables


### Now, can you convert back?

4. Convert a temperature of 5 degrees celsius to fahrenheit?
5. What is hotter, a temperature of 30.2 degrees celsius, or a temperature of 85.1 degrees fahrenheit?


### Make sure everything is documented!

6. If you haven't already, go through your script and add a comment for questions 1-5 explaining what your code is doing.

### Awesome job! Now, let's add, commit, and push your completed script to your `jtc_class_code` github repo

Remember, you'll do this from the command line. First add: 
```console
$ git add temperature.py
```

Then commit to take a 'snapshot':
```console
$ git commit -m 'adding temperature.py challenge'
```

Then push to the remote online!

```console
$ git push origin master
```

Now, go to your online github repository and make sure the changes have been pushed correctly! 

**Congrats! You finished the python bootcamp day1 challenge!!**
