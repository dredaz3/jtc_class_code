    "* A dictionary in python is very similar in that each part of the dictionary has a **key** (i.e. the word), and a corresponding **value** (i.e. the definition). All data in a dictionary is made up of these [**key-value pairs**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-a-keyvalue-pair-to-dictionary-in-python/#:~:text=Dictionary%20in%20Python%20is%20an,key%2Fvalue%20inside%20the%20dictionary.).\n",

    "* We can also edit dictionaries to change what is in them (i.e. they are 'mutable')\n",

    "While lists use hard brackets, dictionaries use the curly braces `{}` to enclose all their data. In fact, a pair of curly braces with nothing inside does make an empty dictionary.\n",

The syntax for this is always `key:value` where there is a colon between the key and value, then different key-value pairs are separated within the dictionary by commas. For example, here's one dictionary with one key-value pair:\n",

    "270.26\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Dictionaries can store all sorts of data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've seen strings and floats in a dictionary, but the *values* can be almost any kind of data. To demonstrate this, let's add some extra information to `user_account`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_account = {'username':'pbloom', \n",
    "                'balance':270.26,\n",
    "                'deposits':[100.00, 21.34, 2.31, 8.06],\n",

    "                'email_notifications': True}\n",
    "print(user_account)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now `user_account` has an item called `deposits` that is a list of floats representing deposits, and a similar list of withdrawals. There is also an item `email_notifications` that is a boolean variable. When we run this code, everything prints out, although it is a little harder to see clearly because there are so many items:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'pbloom', 'balance': 270.26, 'deposits': [100.0, 21.34, 2.31, 8.06], 'withdrawals': [-2.31, -21.43, -78.0], 'email_notifications': True}\n",

    "# 2. Adding / removing / updating data in dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding items\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new item to a dictionary, we add a new key-value pair like so:\n",

    "user_account = {'username':'pbloom', \n",

    "user_account['last_transaction_date'] = '9/15/2020'\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, this adds a new key-value pair with the key `last_transaction` and the value of `'9/15/2020'`. We **assign** the value to the new key as part of the dictionary. Now, if we print out `user_account`, we can see our addition has worked:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'pbloom', 'balance': 270.26, 'last_transaction_date': '9/15/2020'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can add almost any data to a dictionary in this way**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's add an integer value to the dictionary:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_account['user_birth_year'] = 1993\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we print out the dictionary again, we can see this integer `1993` has been added with the key `'user_birth_year'`\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'pbloom', 'balance': 270.26, 'last_transaction_date': '9/15/2020', 'user_birth_year': 1993}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating items\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating items in a dictionary is almost exactly the same as adding new items, except that the **key** we reference is an *already existing key in the dictionary*. This is very similar to the way that updating a variable is like assigning a variable that already exists (re-assigning). We write over the old value and replace it with the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, let's update the `balance`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_account = {'username':'pbloom', \n",
    "                'balance':270.26}\n",
    "\n",
    "# update the balance\n",
    "user_account['balance'] = -500.00\n",
    "\n",
    "print(user_account)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we've updated our balance to `-500.00` by assigning this value to the existing key `'balance'` in `user_account`. When we print out `user_account`, we see our new balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'username': 'pbloom', 'balance': -500.0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: when updating a variable in a dictionary, we don't have to replace it with something of the same type. We *could* have changed the balance to a string or a list, or another data type here if we wanted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing items\n",
    "\n",
    "When removing data from a dictionary, we remove an entire key value pair, since the value can't exist in the dictionary without the key. To do this, we use the `pop()` function with the name of the **key** to remove the whole pair. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_account = {'username':'pbloom', \n",
    "                'balance':270.26}\n",
