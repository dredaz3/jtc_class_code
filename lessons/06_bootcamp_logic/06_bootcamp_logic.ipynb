    "a = 0\n",
    "b = 1\n",
    "c = 1\n",

    "\n",
    "You might be wondering about the double equals sign here. That's normal! This can be very confusing at first, but in python we ALWAYS use **a single equals sign for variable assignment** and **double equals signs to compare whether two variables are equal**. \n",

    "So if we do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will evaluate whether the variable `a` stores a quantity equal to 2. (i.e. we are 'checking inside the box' to see whether 2 is in there). The return will either be the answer `True` or `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing integers and floats with another\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to know about logic with numeric data types (integers and floats), is that mathematical properties are obeyed. So, an integer and a float with the same mathematical value will be found equal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(3 == 3.00000)\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to logic in python, Boolean variables can be used mathematically such that:\n",
    "* `True` is equal to `1`\n",

    "\n",

    "So we get\n",

    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",
    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these help us see that `True` is equivalent to the value 1 and `False` is equivalent to the value 0. In fact if we run the code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(3.5 + True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We get:\n",
    "```\n",
    "4.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as if we had added two numbers together. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "print(True == 'True')\n",

    "Gives us:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, we can see that booleans can be treated mathematically and compared with floats and integers, but they are not so directly comprable with string data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### String Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technically**, we can use ALL of the same logic in comparing strings as with integers, floats, and boolean data types. For example, we can check if two strings are equal to one another and see that case matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# make some string variables\n",
    "a = 'cat'\n",
    "b = 'cat'\n",
    "c = 'CAT'\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if they're equal to one another\n",
    "print(a == b)\n",
    "print(a == c)\n",
    "print(a != c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "So here, we get:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The string variables that have *exactly the same sequence of characters* are equal to one another, otherwise not. And, we can see that **python is case-sensitive**, so the case must match exactly for strings to be considered equal. **But**, things get a little tricky when we try to see whether one string is 'greater' than or 'less' than another. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('cat' > 'bat')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code evaluates to:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weird! Why?\n",
    "* Under the hood, python stores values for every single possible text character using a system called [Unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html). We won't go into this here, but python can compare the unicode values for any two characters or strings, and return `True` `False` based on this. For this reason, unless we are **really** sure we know what we want and how to do it, using `>` or `<` to compare strings may not be the most effective. \n",
    "* Comparing strings to integers/floats/booleans can be odd too for the same reasons. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(2 == '2')\n",
    "print(2 == '2.0')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "False\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, comparing strings to numeric data this way doesn't serve too many uses. "

    "\n",
    "### `and`\n",
    "\n",

    "print(False and True) # only the second is true here\n",
    "print(False and False) # neither are true here\n",
    "print(True and True) # both are true here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "With `not`, this **reverses** whatever existing logical operation exists. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(not 2 > 3)\n",
    "print(not False)\n",
    "print(not True)\n",
    "```\n",

    "```console\n",
    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "False\n",

    "b = 2\n",
    "print(a < 10 and not a > b)\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use the `input()` function in python to ask the user a question, then save their input. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name=input('What is your name? ')\n",
    "print(f'Hi, {name}.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we run this code in a script from the command line, we get something like this with the cursor flashing. It is now 'waiting' for us to enter our input. We can do this by typing the input, then pressing `enter`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/input1.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, then once you (the 'user') enter your input, that input will be assigned to the variable `name`, then printed out in the next line!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/input2.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, we can now combine getting user input with conditional statements!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ask the user if they want to hear a joke\n",
    "answer = input(\"Do you want to hear a joke? (press y / n) \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# code responds accordingly\n",
    "if answer == \"y\":\n",
    "    print(\"I'm against picketing, but I don't know how to show it.\")\n",
    "    # Mitch Hedberg (RIP)\n",
    "elif answer == \"n\":\n",
    "    print(\"Fine.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"I don't understand.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running this in a script, and try giving the responses 'y', 'n', or something else, and see how the code responds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty cool right? Now we're starting to see how powerful python / coding can be for handling user input and starting to **automate** processes on the 'back end'. A lot of this type of logic is used for apps and websites that handle user interaction, using a combination of python and other languages. "
