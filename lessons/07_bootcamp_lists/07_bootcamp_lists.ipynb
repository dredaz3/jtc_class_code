    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If we have existing variables, we can put them inside lists! If we think about this with the box metaphor, this is like numbering a bunch of your boxes, and lining them up in numerical order. When you refer to the box, the contents are still the same!\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it can be really useful to assign an empty list (a list with 0 elements), then add data to it later. We can do this in python with the following syntax:\n",

    "`append()` and `remove()` are really useful ways of getting data into and out of lists, but the fact that lists have **order** makes them extra useful. Because lists are in order, each item in the list also has what is called an **index**, which is a number to mark it's position. Something that is a bit strange but **really** important in python is that **the first index is always index 0**. We can see this in this graphic depiction of a list:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "groceries = ['apples', 'eggs', 'pasta', 'carrots']\n",

    "### What type of data do we get from indexing?\n",
