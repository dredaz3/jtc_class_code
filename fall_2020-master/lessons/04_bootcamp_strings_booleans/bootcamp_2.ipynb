    "# assign a string variable. \n",

    "Amsterdam Avenue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "But, we can add what are called [**escape characters**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp) to get python to read strings in a nicer way for us and format them more particularly. For example, we can use the `\\` to break up big chunks of text inside the code editor.\n",

    "#### Strings with code in them (f-strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be really helpful to have strings with other variables inside them. These are called formatted strings, or 'f-strings', and we can make them by adding a lower case f before the first quote sign in a string. Then, code can be inserted inside the string within `{}`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# set an integer variable called profit\n",
    "profit = 120\n",
    "\n",
    "# make a formatted string that includes the profit variable\n",
    "my_f_string = f'The profit today is ${profit}'\n",
    "\n",
    "# print it\n",
    "print(my_f_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we run this, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python strings.py \n",
    "The profit today is $120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, f-strings can be really useful if we want to print out values of variables with some other text. F-strings can also have equations right inside them, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f'If I earn $200 and expenses are $60, my profit is ${200-60}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows up as \n",

    "```console\n",
    "If I earn $200 and expenses are $60, my profit is $140\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concatenating strings\n",
    "\n",
    "We can concatenate, or join together strings with the `+` sign. It might seem a little weird that 'addition' works with strings, but you can think of this more like joining them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# make 2 strings\n",
    "fruit1= 'apple'\n",
    "fruit2 = 'banana'\n",
    "\n",
    "# concatenate the strings\n",
    "fruit3 = fruit1 + fruit2\n",
    "\n",
    "# print out\n",
    "print(fruit3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the combined strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "python strings.py \n",
    "applebanana\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upper case & lower case\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings have some special functions that allow us to make them all upper (`.upper()`) or all lower (`.lower()`) case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lyrics = \"At first I was afraid\"\n",
    "print(lyrics.upper())\n",
    "print(lyrics.lower())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that these functions convert our entire text to upper or lower case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python strings.py \n",
    "AT FIRST I WAS AFRAID\n",
    "at first i was afraid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings can have numeric characters in them\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't explicitly talked about it yet, but strings CAN have numbers in them, but inside strings, these numbers are **characters** -- i.e the numbers are just read as parts of the text. When numbers are inside string variables, python doesn't consider them to have numeric values in the ways that integers and floats do. "

    "\n",

    "Great, this prints out what **class** each variable is for each of the primitive data types. We'll learn more about classes later on in the course. This kind of use of `type()` can be especially useful if we have complex code and we're not sure what types of variables are being created. \n",
