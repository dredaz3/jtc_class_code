    "#### What is a jupyter notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've run python code using **scripts** (i.e. running files ending in '.py' from the command line). Jupyter notebooks are another way to run python code that is a little less like a script and a little more like a literal 'notebook'. The biggest difference with jupyter notebooks compared to python scripts it that they are **interactive** so that you can run single lines or pieces of code and get output right away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of what is different about jupyter notebooks from the scripts (i.e. 'pure python') we've worked with so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We run jupyter notebooks interactively from a browser (for example Chrome or Firefox)\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks have individual cells that can be run in any order, and give you immediate output right beneath them\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks can have cells of formatted text and graphics embedded in them, so you can view them with your code\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks can run [over 40 other programming languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) too, not just python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use jupyter notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, jupyter notebooks are great for any coding where you want to *interact* with your code, view outputs, and make quick changes. So, they are particularly good for things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **'rough drafting' your code** -- sketching out and debugging your initial ideas where you can test things out easily and interactively\n",
    "* **data science** -- when you're working with data, being able to interact with it and quickly view lots of outputs is helpful\n",
    "* **graphs & figures** -- jupyter notebooks allow graphs and charts to show up inside your notebook file as you're working\n",
    "* **documents & tutorials** -- the fact that notebooks allow you to integrate graphics and nice Markdown text makes them great for making documents that share combinations of code, text, and graphics with others. In fact, *this lesson* is a jupyter notebook, and most other lessons for this class are as well!"
